# LHD:Build-HelloWorld
## About
For the Local Hack Day: Build's challenge "Hello, World in a New Language", I'm using an esoteric programming languages which are often born out of entertaining side-projects and can be described in many ways: fun, fabulous and freaky.<br>
ArnoldC warrants only one description: Get your ass to Mars.
It unveils the true semantics of Arnie’s legendary, classic movie quotes. All the greats are there: Terminator 2, Total Recall, Predator and of course… COMMANDO.

The language isn’t new, but it sure is cool.
